      <h3>Multisource Risk and Compliance Detection Software (MRCDS) - </h3>
      <p>In an organization there is always a
         possibility/risk of sensitive information being shared with
         other organizations knowingly or unknowingly. This can put
         an organization at risk from a compliance or business
         standpoint. Same is true for an individual sharing his or her
         private details at the wrong place knowingly or unknowingly
         which can put the individual in jeopardy. Multisource risk
         and compliance detection software is a software-based
         solution which will parse text from various file formats
         including pdfs, word files, images and emails and will flag
         the sensitive contents from the text which can cause a
         potential security breach. Additionally it also provides features like
         providing a overall risk score, monitoring email accounts for sensitive
         emails and generating special day-wise reports(for emails) for a better all-round analysis.</p>
