      <h3>About Government Scheme Setu (GSS) - </h3>
      <p>Many people in India today are not aware about the different central and state government schemes that are functional. These schemes are based on many different criteria and only those people who fit in the criteria can avail the benefits provided by the schemes. GSS is a
      native android application which recommends government schemes to users(user and his/her entire family) based on some personal information like gender, age etc. This app provides a simple and efficient way to keep a track of schemes relevant to a user and his family.</p>
