      <h3>About EasyQ - </h3>
      <p>EasyQ is a simple virtual queueing app which will allow its users to enter a queue virtually, leave the queue if required and which will provide real time updates to the user about their position in the queue so that they can reach the physical location accordingly (only when their turn is about to come).
      This app provides a simple and efficient way to eliminate the discrepancies of physical queues and will also help us to follow covid appropriate behaviour.</p>
